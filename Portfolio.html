											<h2>Painting: Erro</h2>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Academic assignment for Painting. The purpose was to create a painting based on the theme: Mistake. Complying with the rules of an installation painting, the subtopic I developed is about Environmental awareness. In this, it as made an oil painitng with three faces, each covered by on kind of landscape, urban or nature. This way, the purpose was to adapt the meaning of "The Error" to a concept of Human Error, as the humanity keeps trying not to see the problems it is causing to the planet, blecause of polution, plastic use, global warming and water use, and the living species disappearing

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Project made for a Product Design assignment.The purpuse was to create a razor blade that had something new or different than the remaining others.

This group project pretended to create a sample razor that would be usefull for more that one part of the body, and still keeping the hygiene as a priority.</p>
